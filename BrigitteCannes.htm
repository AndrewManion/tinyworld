     <p><strong>When did you move here? </strong><br>
      One year and three months ago. I bought it and went right away living in it. Before that, I rented on a hill in Vallauris. I had a wonderful view, you know? Even the lighthouse would come in my window. This is really wonderful.</p>

      <p><strong>How did you come to possess this land?</strong><br>
      You could say it’s a life dream. A recurring dream that I’ve had a long time. There was a boat, when I was in the apartment overlooking the sea, that stayed there. Like a bigger sail boat. On the anchor on the next bay, it’s called “Golfe-Juan”. So, it’s very funny. I asked the landlord lady, who was right next to me, she said “oh yeah it’s always there”. I wished that I would meet this person. I made a little prayer that I would meet this person. And do you know, that one day I came back one night from choir and I thought that I’m going to have a nice glass of wine somewhere. *laughs* And I find this pub. I never go so much to pubs, or bars, but it looked like a nice place to go. So, then I drink my glass and beside me there was this guy, who has a, you know, this cable that you roll, you know, electric, how do you call that? It looks a little like this with a little handle. So, I made a joke and I say “oh, some they walk their dog and some they walk their wire”. And see, it’s through him, he was travelling, he has been travelling the world, and he was coming back for his parent. And speaking with him I realize, yes! You know, why did I stop? Each time you stop you have a new relation, or whatever. I thought I had forgotten this dream, a little bit, about the boat. And sometimes you think “ah it’s too late”. You understand? When you see someone living it, it makes it easier for you. And then after I got a chance because this person helped me to get a boat. Seven meters. It was a free boat; they wanted to throw it away. And then after, when my kids came, I thought “it’s too small”. Because they are one-meter-eighty, one-eighty-five, you know? So, I sold the boat. I had it one year. But for a while I had two boats. But before that, it’s really funny, the people from the pub, that I went, yeah, you understand? They also wanted to live on a boat. But on the seven meter I did not live on it. It was way too small. So, they started to search for a boat. They went with this man, the same guy, you know, they went to Hyères to find a boat. I had said to a guy with a boat there, the white rasta man, I said I wanted a new boat, bigger. So, he goes to Hyères and you have to go through all the places. They don’t find a boat so they go through all the places to find a boat. And then he sees this boat with a little 'for sale' sign. It was written very little. The guy almost didn’t want to sell it. But he was sick. So, I called and bought it four days after. *laughs* Of course I searched a little bit for a bigger boat before.</p>

      <p><strong>How does the landscape effect how you perceive your home?</strong><br>
      Ah yeah... *exhales* For example, the landscape, the sea, the movement, affects you a lot. You become less dependent of your outside, you are more… Ok let me organize my thoughts. I think at first, you feel a freedom on the sea. Second, there is a beauty every day, you know? Much more than in a house. It’s just the beauty of nature around. Third, you start to really adapt, and you think, could I really come back to a normal house? You know? The problem, we live with a lot of things. So, we need to reduce. For me, I find getting organized to be very difficult at the time. Okay, maybe it was my weakness, I’m not very, you know, that I’m always dealing with a lot of stuff. Its just my way of being. So, you have to get organized. Keep the goal. And find a lot money! You know a boat costs a lot. When you’re anchored somewhere out you know, the watching over the boat takes a little bit more. There you feel there's a kind of insecurity that you have to manage. You know, you are so concentrated, you know, I say you are in survival mode. It’s such a free life that it’s worth it. Do you know what I mean? And also, the beauty. The wind every day, you have to keep watching. I think even getting older, its really nice, because, you know, when you get older, you get in that mood that you just let things go. Time is just passing by. But there on the boat you have to be really present. Plus, you have to be always jumping in the sea. For example. It makes you fit. You see? Going from a dinghy, that’s already something. You know? And sometimes, the boat, he goes like this, yeah, the rocking. (Do you feel safe?) I go in the summer when there’s not so much wind. When the wind goes over twenty or twenty-five, you stay on board, you keep your boat, or you need a really long chain, which I don’t have. I know this couple who have three dogs and they have a one-hundred-twenty-meter chain. I think I can put still twenty-meters but I don’t think I can put more. When it happens, you have to spend the night just kind of waiting for it to be over, for the next morning. (Did you ever have a doubt?) No. I think my mind is made in such a way that at the moment I refuse doubt. It’s a matter of preparation. Don’t put yourself in the situation you can’t manage. My plan is to avoid long distance without storm. Because I can manage this. But be experimental, that you have to. For me, it’s like an angel like this. Some people they will just go and see what happens. Me, personally, because I am alone, you know? I go step by step. I think it’s okay.</p>

      <p><strong>What is the part of your home which most represents who you are?</strong><br>
      I really don’t know. At the moment, where I am the most is the carré des marins (sailor’s square). It’s a lot of light, I can work, I can have people, you see, and I have the kitchen right beside. When I would be outside it’s the helm or inside it would be here. I guess I manage the social stuff here. The captain and the entertainer, that’s me. I mean, it's nice. Yeah. These pictures were from the last owner. Yeah, I didn't yet change them. Usually, I make my own pictures, but since I'm here, I don't do it. Yeah, there's too much. You’ve got to make sure that there's not leaks first.</p>

      <p><strong>Is there any one thing which you would like to improve about your home or that you feel it is missing?</strong><br>
      Well, at the moment, I'm more improving the reparation, to make a very safe and beautiful boat. You know? And it's kind of difficult, because I bought an old boat. You know? Yeah, there's for me, security and beauty, you see? I think it's working pretty good now. But I would like, I am like you, I want to be doing a world tour. I kind of prepare for a world tour, see? It's a project, I think, with people. Because I will not go by my own. It's not a project, you see, I would do on my own. That’s a project with other people. They might not have to be all the time there. But for me, you know, it's like bucket list more. You start with your bucket list, you know, you are a young man, Andrew. I visited one time, this round house. It does change something with your architecture. You should visit it. Pierre Cardin’s Palais Bulles in Théoule. Maybe one time I would even love to see it with you. I once visited, you know, in Paris, this new art museum. It's called Georges Pompidou. Very special. And it was an expo about how architecture affects our lives. And they spoke about this round stuff.  Can you see living like this? I remember I had some friends; they had a little bit this type of style. At night, it's beautiful.</p>
