      <p><strong>When did you move here? </strong><br>
      It depends. I never ever intended to move here. I ended up moving here twelve years ago because a bitch from hell from England lied her tits off in the British courts and made me homeless in the UK and so I came to what was my summer house. Never ever thinking I would live here permanently. Never ever in my wildest dreams.</p>

      <p><strong>How did you come to possess this land?</strong><br>
      Through guile and intelligence. It means craftiness. When an old lady and her blind son died here, this is true, the property was inherited or was due to be inherited by a lawful beneficiary. And he died before he’d taken proper possession. And then it was left to another relative. This left them in a legal quandary. So, I went to this old farmer and he told me to make a symbolic offer, like very little, because, you know the situation. And I thought, well it’s worth it, worth the risk, you know.  So, I approached a lawyer, on recommendation, and he said “um ah” as lawyers do. And I said, you know, what’s the situation, can you sort it out? And as lawyers do, you know, talking about quite a lot of money, and said he’d do his best, and he would write letters, and this was, I don’t know, whatever month, and then months later I just understood that he was full of shit, and he wasn’t doing a damn thing, but he was pretending he was. So, I said to him, you know, Mr. Whatever he’s called, I’d like to come through to a meeting with you know, please. Would you have all the paperwork out because so we can talk it all through from all the bits of paper. And I went in, I grabbed all the paperwork of his desk, and I said, you cunt, you've done fucking nothing, and you're trying to milk money off me. Go fuck yourself. You've done nothing, and if you try to fucking bill me, I'll fucking Have you one way or another.  So, I went down to the local commune, the council, local council and I explained the situation. I said, “what do I do?” “Can you help me?” And they said, Yeah, of course, we will not a problem. And the lady was very kind and very knowledgeable, and she said, all you have to do is, you know, write this letter to this part of the family. You need two witnesses for every contract in Sweden for it to be, you know, lawful. So, you know, write letter to them, just make sure there's two witnesses for the signatures. So I went, I wrote, I think, two letters and two meetings with the family, and everything was resolved. And it took me three weeks and I got the land for almost nothing.</p>

      <p><strong>How does the landscape effect how you perceive your home?</strong><br>
      The answer to that is quite easy. It’s not so much the landscape as the people. The landscape almost doesn’t come into it. And it’s also… I’m trying to think of the right way to phrase it so that it can be easily put. It’s the changeability of the landscape. It’s like the forest. You would think that the forest will be a steady environment, but it's not this far north. You know, it can be soaking with rain. One day, absolutely soaked. Everything is wet as hell, and the next day the sun can come out. It's a bit like Siberia. That's a similar climate. The sun can shine for only an hour, half an hour, and everything is bone dry. So, it goes from one extreme to the other, and that has a very big effect on the psyche and on your health. It's, it's a very unsteady place to live, and it's very harsh on a human being. It’s not the same in all microclimates. It’s how it is on most of the area here and in this microclimate.</p>

      <p><strong>What is the part of your home which most represents who you are?</strong><br>
      The toilet. *laughs* That is an interesting one. Let me think that one through. *Refills wine glass* I think the veranda because its full of possibilities. It’s the cross roads. Things go into the house, out of the house. Theres a lot light, a lot of change here. It’s not a good place to be in winter but it is in summer. That sort of sums of Sweden and the area. It’s all sort of messy but it has a purpose. And everything is sort of a plan for the future. A nice, long term, gratification. Lots of things are stored here. A nice future. Pleasant things you know.</p>

      <p><strong>Is there any one thing which you would like to improve about your home or that you feel it is missing?</strong><br>
      Absolutely. I don’t have a lounge. I don’t have a place which is just clean and accessible. No dogs, no dirt, no dust. Just a place that I can go for to absolute sort of, not solitude, but clean relaxation, can we call it? And upstairs was designed to be that, but partly because of the staircase and because you have to ascend it, it’s nice just to be able to open a door and walk into a peaceful area. Have you ever read Carlos Castaneda? He’s an American, so you should have read him. He spent a lot of time with Central American Indians in Mexico, with indigenous tribes, and they taught when they went on lots of drug trips together with peyote, they we’re amazing spiritual trips. But Castaneda was a very, very good author. Very good writer. And he would describe his experiences in a stunning detail. And a captivating detail. And there was something special about his writings about places. And one thing that he said was people have points of power or power points. Nothing to do with Microsoft. People have places of power where they feel wonderful, and it can be, it can be inside. Outside. Doesn't matter, usually outside, but everybody can walk through the forest and they come to a place and they just think, this is me. This is where I feel tranquil. Miles from home, close to home. Doesn't matter, you know. And he said, everyone should seek out their places of power. So, when they're feeling down, they go to that place and they feel good. The energy comes back into their body, so it feels power, not nasty power, but a good energy, you know? And he said, those are very, very important. And everybody has them. And for some people, it's a stone out crop. For some people, it's a, it's a knoll in the grassy forest. Different for everybody, but everybody has their places of power, and they may have one, or they may have several. May tell them their lifetime to find it. It may be just outside their doorstep, but that was one of the keys to a happy a good existence.</p>
