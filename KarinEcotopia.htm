     <p><strong>What first inspired you to begin working with tiny houses and ecological building?</strong><br>
      Not “tiny houses”. I have been building very different buildings. So, it's just little tiny houses, but they are different sizes. I have been building nine different houses here. In different ecological materials and different constructions. They are: straw, clay, sand, sheep wool, linen, cellulose, wood, stones from the farm and stamped earth. I’ve been using materials from the farm to build. And on the farm, you have clay, you have stones, you have wood, you have sand? The sheep wool is not enough here... I just have animals that nobody wants. So now, at that moment, I have two sheep, so that's too little. Not enough to build houses with. But to insulate houses. It's nice for insulation.</p>

      <p><strong>What about the construction method?</strong><br>
      They are all located in the same area, which is Ecotopia, located on a farm with seven hectares. But the most important thing was that I made an investigation that was very deep. So, I was really looking exactly for where the underwater flow goes. Because if I build ecological and organic, that's very important. To look where at everything. Where is the clay? Where is the sand? To see how does the topography look? How is the geomantic? How does the energy go on the farm, huh? So, I know where is the middle of the farm and where is the different energy, how it feels on the farm. Where are the are the places where the energy goes? Where you get energy and where you come on a higher level in a geomantie (geomancy) way. But then also, where are the trees? And every house has been put between trees. So, I haven't taken a tree away, you know, and I have just been building there you have soil with which you can't grow. Where there are materials that you can't grow with. So different things I've been looking at lately… I've been looking for every tree that's here, every berry, every medicine plant, every eatable plant. I've been looking for all the natural resources also, where, yes, where you have branches with berries and so on. So, the look, go through seven hectares on different layers, after having a straight structure for the investigation. And then I started to plan the houses.</p>

      <p><strong>What are you referring to when you say “energy”? </strong><br>
      I'm talking about geomantie. And I'm talking about the energy that goes in the soil. The energy, I can't say that's so good in English, but what I'm talking about, if you talk about a place like Ecotopia, it's the same as if you have the different chakras in you. The place also has his chakras. And if you talking about geomantie, you are talking about where the water is going here, where the roots are working here, where the metals is, how it looks with the magnetic fields. You have different magnetic fields on there. And how also the different layers are going. You have ever energy layers. And how they are working and connecting to each other. That's something that you can make measure and you can measure that so you see where the energy is different and how much energy you have on the different places and so on.</p>

      <p><strong>How would you measure something like that?</strong><br>
      I had a professor from Germany who came here, Professor Heike Hensch. He has built up a faculty just for geomantie (he developed the research institute for radiesthesia and geomancy in Nienburg, Germany). I had him here and he was testing the area. He has been working out tools for doing that, yes. We’re talking about geomantie, that's something which is big, not something that we get in a little package.</p>

      <p><strong>You also studied at Darna University in sustainable building courses. Can you speak on your education and background?</strong><br>
      I've been working all my life in mainland Europe in five different countries. And I'm an organization developer and I've been breaking down patriarchal, stubborn organizations and turning them around to get an organic… To to make it organic and regenerative. That means that the organization is following the laws of nature instead of the old paradigm. And then I came back to Sweden, and then I was looking for a new vision. Then, I got this vision, and then I built up an education center for creating a sustainable future and a more self-sufficient lifestyle.</p>
      
      <p><strong>What was your goal when you formed Ecotopia?</strong><br>
      At Ecotopia, you find ecological building. You find ecological growing. You find alternative and nature medicine. You find how to keep animals in a sustainable way. You seen how you open your heart and get contact with your inside and how to manifest. You see it's very different things. And then if I go further on, I have on weekends now, to paint sustainably with the egg tempera you make from eggs, a color, or you make a color out of yogurt of casein and use that for the building side, for clay buildings. And then we come next about water and about… so all these things I think are important for building up the new society. So, it's very different layers...</p>

     <p><strong>I read that you were very inspired by your time in Austria…</strong><br>
 	  Yes, I've been leaving in Austria all my life. I was born in Sweden. I left when I was sixteen years old and I came back in pension. Austria was very, very important for me. Because when I came here and wanted to build the Ecotopia, and I wanted to have all the ecological building materials, for example, and I also wanted to have interesting solutions about warm water and about heating. I wanted to have interesting solutions. The most interesting solution for a roof and so on. So, then I went back to Austria because I couldn't get that here. You don’t get anything. You don't get the all the materials here. And I couldn't even get the windows and the door for a passive house, for such a low energy house. So, I had to get very much, I got the roofs from Austria. The wooden roofs, you know, they take it from over to one-thousand meters on the mountains. And then they take it on the right day, the moon, and then they let it stay for one year, and then they cut it by hand. Then you have a tree, a larch tree, that you don't have to prepare. They can stay hundreds of years, you know, without doing anything. The nature has conservated it. But not just that, I got the sheep wool from Austria, I got the… I got many things, very many things from Austria. And there are many different materials, and as I said, the doors and the windows, and da, da ,da da, da… Also, the solar collector that you can build yourself, where you can get warm water from it, that's also from Austria. But everywhere, there is something from Austria because I couldn't find it here. I see. But I also have things from Czechia. I have things from Litauen. I have things from Poland. And so from different countries… I thought I could get everything here and I couldn't get nearly anything here! So, I had to start to look from where I can get it. They don't use ecological materials in Sweden. They use traditional materials. So, yes, you don't find it here, really. Now you can find some, you can find sheep wool from England, for example. That I couldn't find at that time. So, I got it from Austria. But it's another way of living, in middle Europe, in Austria, because they are using all. I think that has to do with that they were never so rich and it's not such a capitalistic state. Because in Sweden, where money is everything, where everything is needed by money, and in Austria, for example, they had a war before. They were poorer, and they were having much more contact with nature. And they are more practical. And they are building the houses in the family, so they are building their own houses. In Sweden, everything is just built by companies. And in Austria, the people are drawing their houses, they are building that, and the families are coming, or the neighbors are coming and the one is an electrician, and the one has another competence and then they come together and then they build that house. And then they go to another person and then they build that house. Or for the family, you know. So, they are really groups of people who go around and to build for each other in the different areas. And that you don't have here. Here you just have big companies, you get everything ready, it shall go fast, and you just look at the paper and you say “I want the house of the page two-hundred-fifteen”. And then they just ask “how big do you do you want it?” “Okay, it has three sizes”, and then I say, “I take the middle size”, and then they just ask you what you want for colors and then you say, okay, “I want the roof a little bit, you know, grey, and then I want the white, and then I want that”. And then they come and then they build it up. And it can be that they take a whole area and then you have the neighbors living in the same house as you. I think that everybody should plan their own house. They should make all decisions about their own home, because that is where you are going to live... That should be. In Austria, we say that “that's the outside skin of yourself, is your house”. So it should be that you represent yourself, it should be, you know. It's the soul. It's the resonance of your soul. So, when I come in my house, I've been writing, therefore I build the house, because I want to inspire people to build their own houses. And to really draw. To make all decisions. You have to decide. “How do I want to wake up?” “Where do I want to work?” “Where do I want to cook?” “How much light do I need?” “How much warmth do I need in winter?” “How much warmth do I need in summer?” You decide everything, huh? And also, it's not just about decoration. It's really about the whole house, you know? So, you make all the decisions. When I go barefoot, of what material do I want to go? And I think it's very, very important and I think when you make that traveling, you learn to know yourself. And I think that's the most important thing in life. When you make this traveling to build the house, to make the drawings, to make all these decisions on your own, then you learn to know yourself, through that process. Do you understand what I mean? “When you wake up in the morning, what do I want to look at?” It's a decision, isn't it? “When I sit and eat, where do I want to sit?” “How much light do I want?” “Which temperature do I want in the middle of the winter, huh?” “Or middle in the summer, huh?” “How much water do I need in one day?” “How much cold water, how much warm water?” And if you make all those decisions, then you know very much about yourself. And I think it's very, very important. We say in Austria, we say, “we just build one house in a lifetime”. And that's it. You know, you build it when you are young, you build it when you are older. That's depending you, what you're doing. But build one house in a lifetime, you know? And then you have a house that you really believe in. And of course you can make changes, but you have to really think. “What material do I want to have the walls?” “Are the walls going to breathe or are they closed?” You know? You are living with those walls. And how high do I want to have it exactly over my head, huh? And so on. But of course, if you build the house with unsustainable materials, then it's better to go than if you stay one year or longer *laughs*. I think it's about living and building with nature. That’s what I'm talking about. Using nature, what we get from nature. Live and build with that. We are one with nature. And if you do that, then you can never fail. If you take just sand and clay and the stones from the place, you know, and you take the sand up, you will never say, “oh, this is not modern anymore”, or you won't say “oh, I don't like that anymore”. Can you just think about that? Because the clay is so fantastic as a material. You have a material that is always breathing. It's always looking that it's dry, so it always takes the moisture out of the wall, huh? It's working all the time. It's alive, you know? When you come in, you have a certain smell. If we are talking about WiFi, for example, you don't have any WiFi first of all, because it takes it away, you understand? So, all that you get from nature. That was just some examples. And then you will never say, "Oh, I want more WiFi in my home” or “Oh, I want a dead material” or “I want to close the material”. No, I want here a material that's alive. Exactly like my body, it's also a body. It's a live.</p>

     <p><strong>Where are you sitting now?</strong><br>
 	  I'm sitting in the old farmhouse. The old farmhouse was built eighteen-twenty and it's built with dry clay bricks. That's the typical way how we built in Sweden. We had very much clay in the soil. You just take the clay here and you mix it with water and then a little straw, if you have that, or a little hemp or what you have in material. You can take also from a horse, you can take the hair, you know what I mean, huh? *motions as if to show the mane of a horse* And so you mix that in, right? And then you just make with wood, you make a form, and then you just put it in, take the form out after half an hour, let it dry, and then you start to build with that. And so, this house is built. And it has been standing now for two-hundred-five years. It's amazing, isn't it how they did before? Two-hundred-five years. Yeah, eighteen-twenty and now we have two-thousand-twenty-five, so it must be two-hundred-five. I'm always saying when I make a guided tour and I go from the old house and then I go to the new house, what I was talking about before, I always say we go two-hundred years in history. How you build then and how you build now. Ecological. With the materials from the farm, you know?</p>
 
     <p><strong>Have you experimented with materials? Like the types of clay mixtures?</strong><br>
      I haven't I haven't been going through all that process because they are long processes. One who knows very much about straw-bale building, and there you have seven different arts to build with straw. And the next one knows very much about clay building. And there are different ways to work with clay. Also to build materials that you can mix with clay. And so on. You And then you have the stamped earth house and that is something separate. How you can build that… Then you have the wooden houses. You know what I mean? You have the different houses. And everybody is specialized in one material. So, what I did was, when I was building that up, I looked for experts. Expert in clay building, expert in straw bale building. And then I fetched them here and they had a course. So then and we prepared. I have had one builder who has built all of Ecotopia. He made it in eight years. And he always prepared. So, some time it was a little tiny house. So, then he prepared everything and the people were coming on a course, and we had an expert, as leader for a course, you understand? And then people were coming and then they were putting for example, for example, if we talking about fill in method with straw. Then they were putting in the straw and they learned how to do that. Or if we had a clay that could be too plastered with clay, it could be to make the stamped earth house in a weekend and so on and so. So, everything happened so that they were participating in the process. And the expert was giving them the knowledge, and then I was taking knowledge, you know? So, yeah, and then we connected that.</p>
 
     <p><strong>What advice would you give someone who sets out to build an ecological home?</strong><br>
      I went on a course at a school in Dalarna. And that was a course where we were twenty-five people. And we are talking about self-builder. And we had a course and everybody was building their own home. That's a very good thing. And then if you have experts there who can give you knowledge and where you also can ask questions and where you also can learn from me each other. And we went there every weekend for one year.  And that was a good thing. So just to have people who are at the same station in life. Who are thinking ecological. Who want to have everything, want to really to have an ecological building. And who takes the same information in and have the same book, and then everybody is planning all the time, you know, every month you come there and you have been planning your house further on, and then you get advice, you get education, and then you can connect. So, you can give each other ideas. That's a super way. When you are building your house and you just let people come to help you. It is a super thing.</p>
