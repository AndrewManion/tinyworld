     <p><strong>When did you move here? </strong><br>
      </p>What's the date now? Well, the floating house, that’s a very old story. Five years ago, my husband died. He had built the house. And I am his wife. And we were in a very small, thirty-square meters. This is twenty eight. What do you want to know, five years ago he died. And then the government had an old paper. It said when my husband died the house has to be removed. It has only been accepted because it was so nice. I wasn’t living with him though. The house was so that we got conflicted. We were not living together, but I was living in his girlfriend's ex-girlfriend's apartment in Præstø. I lived there and paid her and then we had room for not to fight.

      <p><strong>How did you come to possess this land?</strong><br>
      </p>Because the government wants for the area to be in peace and not fever. And the floating house you saw in the picture was the only one who was floating but protected. It was very rare. They don't want it. But in the beginning, they said you had to make it look nice. Everyone has to say it is ok. It was sinking.  But then every year we get another uh… it was not sustainable. In the beginning I said “ok I build a new floating house”. And I draw a… *exhales* I forget the whole story! *smiles* I draw and draw and think about the floating up because when you have a house… on the roof, the walls, and the roof. and then you have to get uplift… the power to float… Today I know what I should have done. *smiles* 

      <p><strong>What should you have done?</strong><br>
     </p>I don’t tell you! Because it had cost me thousands of hours to think about how do we do this. For me I have only just got it. “Oh I should have done that”. Because you are on the market… What did the people want you to buy? They have solutions that they never think about… you can use a solution. For example, a water bed. Lie on the big, big waterbed. And you can use that on the water too. It's only an example of what people are offering you in the world and how you can use it. That's not the same. No. I mean, you can look at an option. Now we take the water bed. You can put it beside you… you can it put it out on the water! And have it as another choice for in the water! I only want to say to you that… you don’t have to… Ahhh I’m very very pissed-off-in-a-corner because I cannot explain. I can not in English. Can we drink a little beer?

     <p><strong>So, we were talking about how you got this land...</strong><br>
     </p>The government kind of ordered me to leave Perlen. They had the paper which said when my husband is dead the story is finished. How did I get it… In the beginning I only wanted to live on the lake because it was more space and very good. I said to Christiania I'm willing to leave but only if I can have another place, of course. And they asked me, would you like to live there or there or there. *points around* I came to Christiania and said, because we have a big deal with the government here, with six houses they wanted us to put down, and Perlen (name of the floating house, the house we sat in was named Morkansol which meant Morning Sun) was the only one they really wanted to get rid of.
I have drawn a lot of new houses to be floating like Perlen. Because that was the plan in the beginning. But then Christiania asked me, what if you took the old Morkansol and built a new house there? I said “that will do”. But we haven't been allowed to build there because it is very near to the protected areas. But they say ok we want to remove Perlen so okay we put that there. It was a deal. And I loved that house, Morkansol, the old house, it was totally green and all over. I have a picture but you can’t see the house. Just a little window. But I loved that house and I’d been living there since ninety-seven. And Perlen, it was dark and wet, but I loved it. So, when the people here asked me: "what do you think about that, to be here? because we can get the government to help us". And then I said, yes. 
They said, if you leave there, you can have this. Because it is in my old hood, I have lived here and go meeting people and everything. I know the… that’s big issue for me, that I'm home. And then was a big Whoa! how it ended… Didn’t you think it was great.

     <p><strong>How does the landscape effect how you perceive your home?</strong><br>
     </p>I can tell you quite clear that the surrounding is more than fifty percent. If the house is forty-nine percent, then the house is fifty-one. It is the main thing. The main…. I can hear that it sounds crazy, but that's the main thing. Therefore, I really want to be in this area. Because of nature. I live here so long. Because of the nature. You can say that you understand it when you are here, you see. You' sense it. It is marvelous. But it's also… the other day I going swimming in the early morning and I come down and there was a mysterious, big, uh, surroundings of clothes, floating and… together about the bridge there… and looks very weird. And I get it, sometimes you find there… stuff. Have you been there? A lot of people. And I go swimming, and I get up and I home and I think, okay it's not my stuff. And then, that day, much later, I see a very thin, totally *makes choking sound* weird, totally naked, walk with those clothes. Not well you know. And totally naked *laughs*. 
When I came here and got married to my husband, I came from a little village in the countryside. I come from near Ørbæk. But I have been living for a couple of years in a little village where everybody knows everybody and we have a good life and so on. Here and Christiania also I live in a community and then everybody knows nearly everybody. That’s the way I do like it. When you are a close community. Do you mind if I am smoking? Do you want a cigarette? 


      <p><strong>How much did it cost to build the house?</strong><br>
      </p>A quick answer is one million. It's not my land. Christiania owns the lands. They also own the house. It's not my house. You have been living in Milkabutton with Barney and you don’t know anything? Oh but you got here last night, sorry, sorry. We have not buildings to make money. To put into a bathroom and a kitchen and then we sell it and get a bit more. That’s not the point here. You cannot sell. I cannot. It’s not mine. So, you have to skip that old story of capitalism “ok I use one hundred kroners there and when I sell it, I got two hundred kroners”. If you put two hundred kroners, you appreciate it yourself but no one else. You understand me? Because, it is my money that I used for this, some part of it, some of it is coming from other places, but I cannot… It’s not mine. I cannot sell it. When I leave… I don’t. I never die. If… In case it should happen, there will be another that will say “ok I would like to live here” and the new person pays the money it costs. In the whole system. What we pay every month, he and she and everybody pays. Everyone in Christiania pays. Barneys does. We have a limit. You have to pay this. It depends on how many quarter-meters you have. Here I have twenty-eight square meters. Two or three thousand kroner per month. Maybe it is more like three. To build it was about a million. I paid the whole thing now because it was my idea and uh… but if I am not here another will come and will say “I’d like to pay the same as Lise and have her home”. God forbid it! 
You have to change your mind about doing things to get something out of it. In a way. It’s not yours. My husband who has built the other house, Perlen, he was aware it was not his house but he has built it, paid for it all and done it all himself. But it was not his. But he was satisfied. What’s not to like?

      
      <p><strong>What is the part of your home which most represents who you are?</strong><br>
      </p>Don't be cruel. Because all the things is me. This and this and this and this.  Sorry, that is my best answer. Everything. Everything. Or nothing. It's also a little empty, to say. There's nothing I am very deeply involved in and love very much. I love everything.

      <p><strong>Is there any one thing which you would like to improve about your home or that you feel it is missing?</strong><br>
      </p>I don’t answer. Anything I’m missing? I'm not sure if it got to be with the wood inside the house or it should be down here, that we have a little fire here in the evening. Or here. Or a television.
