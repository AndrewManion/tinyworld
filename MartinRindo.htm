      <p><strong>When did you move here? </strong><br>
      It’s my summer house. My father built it in nineteen-eighty-five. I have only been here for the vacation period. During Covid I started to be here a lot. I would say I didn’t like it so much when I was young. Then I rediscovered it when I came back from my South America trip. My apartment was rented out and I said “ok, its kind of cool here”. At first, I didn’t like it because my neighbors didn’t like that my father bought a bunch of land and built a house. Typical Swedish way. I always had the feeling that people didn’t like us here. Like everyone around. So, it’s been a big thing for me to change that view, and now people are saying, ok so he’s the son and that’s ok.</p>

      <p><strong>How did you come to possess this land?</strong><br>
      So, it’s for tax reasons. It’s so stupid but, in Sweden, if you inherited something you have to pay tax. But, if you give something as a gift, its zero tax. So, my parents gave me and my sister this when we were fifteen-years-old. So, I co-own this with my sister. We have it fifty-fifty. I do ninety percent of the work but we share the cost.</p>

      <p><strong>How does the landscape effect how you perceive your home?</strong><br>
      How I’m looking at my home because of the landscape? Yeah, exactly. So, the idea about the question is if we take this house and put it somewhere else, it will be another? I would say, to answer this question, it’s the total opposite as it would be about the other house in north. When I was younger, I would come here with a car on Friday evening. And it’s not only one time when I arrived in the afternoon and a friend is calling me and saying there’s an amazing party in Stockholm. So, I take my car two hours back to go. Yes, it’s an island, but its still so close by car. When I was younger, I could never feel peace here in the same way as in the north. It was always this drawing night club, bar, concert, like in the big city. Present, even if I was here. When we go to the north it’s five hours driving away at least. If a friend called and said something, I can’t. But here, I can actually. I grew up in the islands. You could blindfold me, put me on a boat and put me on an island, and even though its twenty-four-thousand islands, I can tell you “ok, we are here”. Or at least what part of the archipelago I am in. I started with my own boat, high speed motor boat, when I was fifteen. Grinda, for example, when I was fifteen, we would sleep in the boat but it was completely smelling like gasoline. So, you prefer to sleep in a tent. You’re in the middle here, between. I don’t have a problem with it now but when I was younger it was stressful. I was a clubbing animal at that time. More than once, I was here, and I wasn’t staying as long as I was planning. But now it doesn’t happen. I’m here.</p>

      <p><strong>What is the part of your home which most represents who you are?</strong><br>
      The upstairs bathroom. The whole area upstairs. I’ve been very heavily involved in that. And then the garden actually. The garden I think I have improved a lot since I’ve been here. Well, my mother was always here with flowers and plants. She’d hate me if I said that. But I think I’ve done a little more in the garden. The waterfront I am upkeeping of course. But it was my father’s idea to make it how it looks. To cut the grass and take away the bush. The intention for the waterfront has always been to build a house there but its protected. By law you can’t build more than one hundred meters to the seashore. In the archipelago you can completely destroy an old house, the same size, build a new one, without any big problems. But if nothing was present there before its impossible. We have seventy meters to the seashore. It’s to close. For the tiny house, my father fought a lot and found some old photography from one-hundred-fifty years ago that there was a house there so we are going to build a new one. That’s when the neighbors got completely crazy like “oh, you’re building too close to the water!”.</p>

      <p><strong>Is there any one thing which you would like to improve about your home or that you feel it is missing?</strong><br>
      I want to finish the unfinished things. Since nineteen-eighty-five it looks like that *points at unfinished walls*. So, finishing some of those things would be good. I want to have a sauna down at the water. But my sister doesn’t like saunas. She wants to have it as it is. I want to build a sauna in that small little house. It’s popular to have floating saunas in Sweden. You can have a floating sauna as long as you have an engine, a really small engine even. Then its technically a boat and no one can complain. They can complain maybe if you don’t move it for one year, but if you go once around in a circle then they can’t do anything. It’s the same with the caravan. If I have it there all summer, people can complain. But if I move it a few meters than they can’t do anything. Before, people were sitting on our dock. Families were having picnics etcetera. Then suddenly my father comes and says he bought it and they say “no its not possible because its public land”. And my father said no look at this. But this was before the internet so it was hard to see. So, you had to go to the municipality and there you could see it. Then they realized my father was right and he had bought it. It was included in this land the house is on. It’s two separate locations but it’s the same land. And, for example, we can disconnect them. Then the law is that I can disconnect that area (the waterfront) from this land. But, if I manage to do that, then I also have the right to build there. So, the only thing we can do is disconnect this land from that land. If we would be able to disconnect that land (waterfront) from this then it would be valued as much as all of this together. Having a place like that where you can build so close to the water the value would be insane. We are waiting. Maybe the laws are changing. Right now, if we disconnected and tried to sell it, they would not pay much at all.</p>
