     <p><strong>When did you move here? </strong><br>
      I used to work in Agadir. In a totally different business. I used to rent tapes, video tapes. Filming ceremonies, weddings, etcetera. And then I had an internet café. And that made some money so I searched for somewhere to buy land near the sea. I discovered Imsouane in two-thousand-four.</p>

      <p><strong>How did you come to possess this land?</strong><br>
      In two-thousand-four, at that time, I bought the land. At that time, it was very cheap because no one wants Imsouane, it wasn’t famous at that time. I bought two pieces of land. This land and another land five minutes walking from here. The other land I built in two-thousand-eleven. We bought it from the factory which is half the government and half private people. They make water, electricity and roads. They started offers for sale. At that time it was very cheap. If you paid cash, they gave it to you for ten percent less. I paid cash so I had ten percent less. But then people discovered Imsouane and the office finished selling all the land. So now people are selling it for the second time, third time... So the price is growing, growing, growing. Before, the internet company was a very good business. I made some money there so I started to look for somewhere to buy land. But it needed to be in a place where the government makes water and electricity. So, I started looking in Agadir but then I was told to come to Imsouane. I went to an office and they told me about Imsouane, though its far from Agadir. I decided to buy it because it was very cheap. I wanted somewhere to retire and to live. I bought two properties because I have a brother. He wanted to buy somewhere here but he didn’t have money so I gave him an advance. But, in the end, he didn’t want it. So, I kept it. Which in the end is good. For building in Morocco, you need a license to build and to have a license you need water and electricity. You need to have the plans all permitted. The infastructure was already there, the government made it and put it for sale. The houses built in front of this house, they were built illegally. The showers and the toilets were going into the sea. There was no electricity. But everybody is building because they see you building, so, they want to build as well. Every day there is a new little house coming. Most of them were building during the night. I came here one night then the next day there is a new one. The government couldn’t stop it. It was too much. The government knocked them all down. At the beginning, it was just two or three houses for fishermen. Little ones. But every year you had more houses. I saw about fifty or sixty houses built in three years from two-thousand-eighteen. For my design here, it was a dream to build this hostel. I already had the experience from the first house. I was thinking all the time, every day, of how it would look like. I have an architect friend in Agadir. So, I start with him and I had many ideas in my head. I spoke with him and it took us a few times to have it finished. The final design, it came from Pinterest. I saw a lot of designs there that I used as inspiration. Normally, it’s big white, not big blue, because it’s white. Big white, little blue.</p>

      <p><strong>How does the landscape effect how you perceive your home?</strong><br>
      In Morocco there have been lots of changes. The whole country. It’s been changing a lot for the last ten or fifteen years. Its growing very quickly. Lots of people, through social media, are discovering Imsouane. Every year there are more and more surfers coming from all over the world. From South Africa, from Canada, from America. But I think the Moroccan government is clever enough to know what is good and what is not good for tourism. Tourism specifically here is surfers, lots of young people. So, they don’t like lots of buildings. They like peaceful places, medium not very expensive. Here there will be a skatepark, some restaurants maybe small little hotels. We are very lucky to be here in Imsouane. The weather is very nice, the people you meet every day are very interesting people. Everybody is talking. For instance, you see, you are talking to the guy from Ireland and you are talking to the girl from Austria, right? And it’s all a big mixture which is very, very good for us, good for the clients, and everybody likes it. The waves are good, the weather is good, the food is also good. It’s the best place to live!</p>

      <p><strong>What is the part of your home which most represents who you are?</strong><br>
      I wanted to have two rooms with balconies. So, if one is full then I have another one free. That is the good place in the house. Also, the rooftop. Every year we always make something new. It was not all finished in two-thousand-eighteen. We finished the roof, then the basement, then the kitchen. When I make some money, then I invest it. We still have a lot to do.</p>

      <p><strong>Is there any one thing which you would like to improve about your home or that you feel it is missing?</strong><br>
      Nothing is really perfect. We still have a lot of things. There’s an outdoor shower which people don’t see or use. We have a lot of things to change. Maybe in summer we close for a few weeks and make all this kind of work. It takes time in Morocco. Slowly, but good.</p>
