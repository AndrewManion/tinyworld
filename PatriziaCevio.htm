      <p><strong>When did you move here? </strong><br>
        
      <p><strong>How did you come to possess this land?</strong><br>
      We just bought it. We looked down from the mountain cabin and it looked abandoned and we said “hey, this would be a fucking awesome place”. We started to ask people from the village if they knew something about it and they all told us it was difficult because it had been empty for so long and no one actually knew who owned the property. So, we started this whole process of figuring out the heirs. It took us almost three years to buy it.</p>

      <p><strong>How does the landscape effect how you perceive your home?</strong><br>
      This house was, when we found it, very raw. There were openings for windows but no glass. And there were only fire places, no insulation. The house, as I perceived it when we discovered it, I could really perceive how people had such a hard time living here. We are in a north-south valley so it is pretty clear that the winter is shady and that it must have been very cold here in winter time. I thought these people must have really suffered. They were so hungry and didn’t have enough chestnuts. And so, we knew we had to make it more liveable and so we came up with intelligent heating solutions. And, since we are in the forest, we chose to heat everything, even the water, with wood. The landscape… when there is a lot of rain there’s so many waterfalls. It feels like where Elron lived in Lord of the Rings. Also, there was nothing inside here but stones.</p>

      <p><strong>What is the part of your home which most represents who you are?</strong><br>
      I think the kitchen. The kitchen is, anyway, very important. Its where you meet and where you eat. I think someone who knows me well would recognize this kitchen as being my kitchen. I think a kitchen is very personal, even more than your bedroom. Not only the furniture, but I like to be open and I didn’t want to have little doors so people ask me “where are the plates?” or something. The kinds of spices I use, I think that’s very personal. The wooden spoons, the handmade stuff. This wall with all the memories and travel and random people, and family members, drawings from my students... And also somehow chaotic, you know? Spontaneous.</p>

      <p><strong>Is there any one thing which you would like to improve about your home or that you feel it is missing?</strong><br>
      Yeah, I mean, I think it is a work in progress. Even though we tried to finish it in a way its really not. We don’t want it to be a permanent construction site. We didn’t want to move in before it was finished with all the details. But I mean when we did it the conception was for the four of us, and the daughters were little, and we had this idea of not having many doors and in fact my bedroom had no door and it was part of the living room. But the passing of the years… The daughters got older and wanted more privacy and I wanted more privacy and so we put these little doors here and there. Actually, the personal preferences can change in your life. I’m a professional woodworker so I don’t have to spend money to modify something but even if I wasn’t… its really nice, its dynamic, its in progress. I think it’s never really finished. It has an evolution, I think. Consider that before we came it was used in a different way. There were three families living in here and sharing all the space. And who is coming after me is probably going to change something again. Maybe it would have been wise to do more bedrooms because actually we don’t have many bedrooms for many people, I mean the bathroom is very huge it could have been a bedroom there. But we had this idea of a wellness bathroom. Its so much wood I have to burn to make my bath. We used to bath all together and that made sense. I only like cold baths in the lakes and rivers. </p>
