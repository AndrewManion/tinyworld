      <h2 class="text-xl font-normal mt-1">Cevio, Switzerland</h2>

      <p><strong>When did you move here? </strong><br>
      It cannot be answered in one number because we arrived here when we were twenty, and were still in the woodworking school, and we bought the mountain cabin with friends. We arrived there twenty-five years ago. By restoring there and discovering the area we saw this and later moved here. It was in two-thousand-nine, I think. We started by camping here and cutting down the trees and everything. If you calculate this it was sixteen years ago, so in two-thousand-nine. Yeah, makes sense. But I mean, moving in the house, when it was finished, it was maybe in two-thousand-twelve. So, three years later. The first summer we camped and then the winter arrived and we moved into an apartment in Cevio for about seven months. And during these seven months we lived there and fixed up the tiny house here. Where Lisa is staying. Maybe you haven’t seen her yet, because I think she’s on holiday, but we made this house in those seven months while we stayed in Cevio and then we moved in there. Maybe it took a little longer than seven months because actually the roof we started in summertime, when we were camping, and in the Autumn, we worked for other people to get some money. In the winter time we did everything inside. But the roof was already made. Because over there, we also had to do the whole roof because it was raining inside and we wanted to make it also a little higher. Okay. It was like lower than the whole thing. So it was a gradual process because there was so much here on the land to fix up.</p>
        
      <p><strong>How did you come to possess this land?</strong><br>
      We were just asking. I mean, we just bought it. We looked down from the mountain cabin and it looked abandoned, even from one thousand meters higher up, and we thought “hey, this would be a fucking awesome place”. Let’s go and check. So, we went down and came here and we saw that it was so abandoned and we started to ask people from the village if they knew something about it, who were the owners and so on. And they all told us oh it is difficult because it had been empty for so long and no one actually knows who owns the property and then we found out that they are already dead, and we have to find out who are the heirs, and so on and so on. It took us, I think I told you, almost three years to buy it.</p>
 
      <p><strong>How does the landscape effect how you perceive your home?</strong><br>
      You know obviously the mountains, but being in the valley… I mean, this house was, when we found it, very raw. There were no windows. There were openings, but no glasses. And only fireplaces, no insulation. The house, as I perceived it when we discovered it, it really felt like I could really perceive how people had such a hard time here, especially in winter time.  Because I knew this is a shady place, because the mountains are so steep nearby and we are in a north-south valley, not east-west, so it is pretty clear that the winter is shady and that it must have been really, really cold in wintertime. So that was actually what I perceived first and I thought that these people must have really suffered, also in winter. And you can also read this in the old stories that the people were really, really suffering in the winters and sometimes they were also hungry because they were so many and they had not enough chestnuts or whatever. So, I mean, we knew we had to turn it into something more live-able and make all the insulation, an intelligent heating system that can work with what we have here. We wanted to use the resources from the clay. Since we are in the middle of the forest, we decided to heat everything by wood, including the water. So that was, yeah, I mean, the landscape definitively influenced also the choices that were made for renovating this place and the design. This landscape, it reminded me, because when there is a lot of rain, I think I told you there is a lot of waterfalls, and somehow it reminded me also of the Rivendell, you know, from the Lord of the Rings. Yeah, right, the Rivendell, where Elrond is living, there are all these waterfalls. And sometimes I thought it actually looks like they’re like those steep mountains and then in the autumn you have also this golden sunlight and those waterfalls and that has inspired also our indoor design because we have a lot of those middle age ornaments, you know? The house was completely empty; it was just stone walls. Here was closed *points to the opening from the kitchen to the living area* We took off some of the walls to have more space, more light that goes through the house. But there was actually nothing inside here but stones.</p>

      <p><strong>What is the part of your home which most represents who you are?</strong><br>
      Hmm, that’s a good question. I think the kitchen. The kitchen is, anyway, very important. It’s the most important place in the house, I think because its where you meet and where you eat. I think someone who knows me well would recognize this kitchen as being my kitchen. I think a kitchen is very personal, even more than your bedroom. Not only the furniture, but also, because I like to be open and I like to see things. I never wanted all these little doors so people ask me “where are the plates?” and “where are the glasses” and so on. But also, you can find me here. I mean, you know, the kinds of spices I use, I think that’s very personal. The wooden spoons, the handmade cups and stuff like that. This wall with all the memories… some travels, some random people, but also my kids, some dear friends and whatever… drawings from my students... And also somehow chaotic, you know? Spontaneous.</p>

      <p><strong>Is there any one thing which you would like to improve about your home or that you feel it is missing?</strong><br>
      Yeah, I mean, I think it is a work in progress. Even though we kind of tried to finish it in a way, its not. Because we said we don’t want it to be a permanent construction site. It should be ready when we move in. We didn’t want to move in before it was finished with all the details. But I mean when we did it, the conception was for the four of us, and the daughters were little, and we had this idea of not making too many doors and having open space everywhere. In fact, my bedroom had no door and it was part of the living room. And, you know, we kind of shared all the space. And with the passing of the years, when the daughters grew older and wanted more privacy, and then recently I wanted more privacy, and so I made the door here and put this window there. I could close with this wooden panel there. So, you know, I think it depends very much on who is moving in and out. And you may still make changes. Because actually the personal needs, they can change in the life. And if you have the possibility to do it on your own because you are you, I mean I’m a professional woodworker so it’s not a problem. But even if I wasn’t, I mean, it is just nice. It’s also life, a house is like real life. It’s dynamic, it’s in progress. I think it's never actually finished or I mean, it has an evolution, I think. I mean, consider that before we came here, it was used in a different way. There were a lot of people living in here, three families, they were in here. And who is coming after me probably is going to change again, something. Maybe it would have been wise to do more bedrooms, because actually there's not so many. We have not many bedrooms for many people. So, I mean, the bathroom is quite huge. It could have been maybe another bedroom for somebody and made just a smaller bathroom maybe on this level. But we wanted it to be a bathroom because we had this idea of this design, this wellness kind of bathroom. But it's actually a little bit of waste of space, I find it now. We’re not using the tub so much anymore because it's actually so huge that it needs so much water and since we heat it on our own, I mean it's just so much wood I have to burn to make my bath. I mean, I can decide not to fill it up completely. The option is to go bathing with two or three people. Actually, sometimes we bathed all of us together. That was actually fun and it made sense. Otherwise, it's just actually a lot, for one person. Unless you want to do a cold bath, but I don't like cold baths. Except in the lakes and in the river. This plaster in the bathroom, it's lime, and also the inton (plaster) is made of lime. This element stone we used to shape all the shower and to shape the tub. That's what's underneath. Okay. And Lyme has the same as clay, as I told you, that it absorbs and releases humidity, so it's kind of compensating humidity. But I actually, still I still have some kind of mushroom down there now, I wonder why. Also, inside the shower, it's actually getting a little black… I don't know. It's there. The problem is that it's not really a good air changing there. But yeah, I mean, I'm not an expert on plasters and lime and clay and all those materials, so for not being an expert, it's, I mean, it turned out well.</p>
