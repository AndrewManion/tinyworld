      <p><strong>When did you move here? </strong><br>
      December two-thousand-eighteen.</p>

      <p><strong>How did you come to possess this land?</strong><br>
      It’s an interesting story actually. Me and Pontus… The neighbors who used to own this, the horse people who live down that way, they were in debt to the tax department. They took some of the property to pay their debts. Pontus and I were still married and we bought it for different reasons. I because I loved it and thought it was awesome. Him because at least we know someone wouldn’t do something on this land we didn’t like. There was an interesting situation with the water rights… Pontus’s house uses the well from this property. We had the rights to use the water from this property. But, if it got sold to someone who had some kind of very high water use, and there was none left for us, we could not tell them that “hey come on we have a right to the water too!” because it would be their right to use it for whatever they wanted. So, if they had a business that used the water, we’d have to dig our own well. For Pontus that meant this was a good idea. So, we took a loan and bought it. We bought the land in February two-thousand-sixteen. We already had the house where Pontus lives, and the one hectare of land that came with it. Here, there was the stable and two hectares of land that belonged to this property here. We bought it from the authorities who were selling it but it belonged to our neighbors. Our neighbors are still living their and they had another ten hectares. They only lost a small portion of their land and they had to build a new stable. It wasn’t that bad for them really. There was no friction between them and us. Between them and the tax department, yes. But with us, no. He was claiming that he was right to the tax department, that he didn’t owe them anything. They were not upset with us for it. Even they’ve said at some point that if it had to be sold, we are glad that it was you. And then, when we decided to get divorced, the best solution we came up with, as a divorced couple, for our housing situation, was that he kept the house, because I couldn’t afford it anyway, and I got this piece of land. So he kept all the loans that we took for buying the house and this piece of land. I didn’t get a home but I got a piece of land with no loans on it. That was the reason I was able to… The bank wants some security for the loan to build the house. So, the land was my security. Also, because my mum loaned me a vast sum of money. Well, vast in my opinion. So yeah, I owe my mom lots of money but she says “I know you won’t pay it back before I’m dead but I don’t know what I’d do with it anyway”. I’ll inherit the money anyway, well my brother and I will. It took almost a year to get the building permit. The first half year we were still living together, Pontus and I, but we were saying “Goshhhhh this is taking a long time”. Not because we were hating together but because we wanted to get on with our lives. We didn’t want to share a home anymore. So, I lived in the Pslinger, your little house, during the summer.  But there were no utilities, no water, heating or anything. I’d go down to the main house to use the bathroom. The kids were living down there too so I’d I spent a lot of time down there. Then it got too cold so I moved down into Altop, the stable, which had electricity so I could heat things. But it didn’t have so I carried water in buckets. And I had a kitchen. And I lived in there until the house was ready to move into. That was just before Christmas. And Arvid and I greeted the house when it arrived on a trailer. It was one of those trailers with two wagons. One half was on the front and the other on the back. It was sealed up with plastic and some boards. I think Arvid was twelve at the time. We were there to greet them when they came with the house. It came a bit before lunch and they unloaded it. The plinths that it stands on we’re already fixed, the sewage was fixed several months before, the water pumps were laid, the electricity chord was laid, but we couldn’t hook it up until a few weeks later when the electricity was finalized. It was quite fun the day they came, but it was the twenty-ninth of November so it was very cold. A couple days later a few guys came to install the wood stove, you and I *talking to Arvid* went up when it was three degrees and we made a roaring fire and got it up to nineteen degrees. It is well insulated. It came from the north. The building barracks there. Well, it was north but not above the half, in a much colder climate regardless. So yeah, it’s well insulated. It had been used as changing rooms for a building site. Well, a deconstruction site. The company that sold it to me, they make trailer homes. Custom made also. I could just tell them “I wanted this wall removed. I wanted the sliding door for the bathroom”. And with Ikea, you can online design your kitchen. The carpenter had prepared it, putting in the correct measurements. Then I was allowed to play around with different kitchen parts and change the bench tops etc. So, I had done some of the designing myself. The glass doors there were metal at first. The bedrooms are original, the floor, the ceiling, the lamps. Theres a lot of stuff I didn’t change.</p>

      <p><strong>How does the landscape effect how you perceive your home?</strong><br>
      My lifestyle and life philosophy is all about finding a way to be human without exploiting other species. So, I’m absolutely not saying that I have achieved this yet, but that is my aim and that’s what my philosophy is about. Because it’s hard to learn it! Its like being raised in a racist society and trying to learn to not be racist anymore. It’s an effort because you have all these perceptions in your head that you’ve had since you were a baby and everyone around you has. It’s something you have to invent. So, the landscape is my teacher. The landscape is teaching me to find another way. Like ideally, the nature, the landscape is my home. But I do need a bit of warmth and comfort so I do need a bit of structure as well. Ideally, I want there not to be a boundary between my indoors home and my outdoors place. I’m not there yet but that’s the direction I’m trying to move. The place here is very much defined by the bigger trees here, there’s that clump of ashes, and the ones I told you had the lightning strike in it. Those ones and these ones really define the corners of my land. They mean quite a lot to me and the place I call home. I’m on a slight slope which also makes sense to be on the higher ground, a bit drier. I don’t know, it just feels right to be here. I’ve walked around to choose my spot to be on. When it was yay high with nettles. So, I’ve walked around the space to figure out where I wanted to live. Another thing is that I want a tiny house on a big piece of land. I’ve wanted that since I was like twenty. And I got it when I was forty-eight. Nearly forty-nine. Yeah, nearly forty-nine.</p>

      <p><strong>What is the part of your home which most represents who you are?</strong><br>
      *points at the cissus* But I didn’t know I was going to have the cissus in here. There were a few things that I decided before. One thing was I really wanted a lot of daylight coming in. Pontus’s house doesn’t have a lot of daylight coming in. And I wanted the fireplace, its weird having a country home without one. I also did not want a water flush toilet. I wanted a composting one. And I built it myself. So that one also represents me quite a lot. </p>

      <p><strong>Is there any one thing which you would like to improve about your home or that you feel it is missing?</strong><br>
      Oh yeah, the greenhouse definitely. There are a few things I want to do. Because I grow a lot of food, and I aim to grow even more. There’s the issue of where do I store it. And this kitchen doesn’t really have enough storage for a homesteader who grows their own food. So, I am planning on taking this cupboard and moving it forward eighteen centimeters that way and it will look like a book shelf that comes out like this. And it will have wheels on it. And its only got to be wide enough to have a lot of jars on it. That’s one other thing I need to do because my lifestyle demands it. The greenhouse is also essential to my lifestyle because when I need to move plants inside, I don’t have enough windows to have plants all around. This is one way I’ve gotten around it to pre-grow beans, imagine there is like fifty beans in this pot, if I had 50 little pots. If you ask Arvid, that light there is special for growing plants. So that spot has been crowded with little plants like chili plants. So, more space for plants. And that I’m going to get from the greenhouse as well. I also don’t have a proper bookshelf. I have one that I want to build. I want it to go around here *motions to living room* and encase the television and go all around. I might use the oak floor panel that I showed you. If there’s enough to use in the tiny house and for here. But it’s prioritized for the tiny house. Oh yeah, and I want to make the tiny house because I want there to be a place for Alvid or Ejvind once their older. There are two bunk beds in there but Ejvind usually sleeps on the sofa.</p>
